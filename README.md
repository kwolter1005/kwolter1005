- Hi, I am @kwolter1005
- I am seeking satisfying full or part-time remote work involving data analytics and/or data management which will also provide professional experience and development. I have extensive background knowledge and interest in all types of technology. I am hard working, creative, energetic, and responsible. In-person onsite work will be considered in my local area.
- Currently teaching myself data analysis with MSQL by following Delivery Business Intelligence with MSQL Server by Brian Larson.
- Looking to collaborate on not really anything at the moment, unless it involves me learning more about data analysis.
- Reach me kurt@gmail.com
