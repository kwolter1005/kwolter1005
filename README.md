- 👋 Hi, I’m @kwolter1005
- 👀 I’m interested in getting experience, and a job, not necessarily in that order, related to data analysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to follow the instructions in Agile Data Science 2.0 by Russell Jurney.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not really anything at the moment, unless it involves you teaching me more about data analysis.
- 📫 How to reach me kurt@kurtsweb.xyz
